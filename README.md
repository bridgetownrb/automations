# Bridgetown Automations

A collection of helpful automation scripts that can be applied to [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com) websites.

Simply run `bundle exec bridgetown apply URL`, where URL is this repo URL along with the automation filename. You can also run an automation as part of a new site setup using `bundle exec bridgetown new mysite -a URL`.

If you already have an automation script you like to use, you can include additional automations by calling `apply_from_url`. For example:

```ruby
# my_script.rb

apply_from_url "https://github.com/bridgetownrb/automations/netlify.rb"
```
